service-exe-lifetime
====================

Visual Studio vNext console and Windows service solution.

How does the lifecycle of a windows service differ from an executable?

A Windows service is designed to run without user assistance. An executable requires user assistance although it can be
scripted to behave like a Windows serivce.

Example of using log4net.
